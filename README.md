# squeezebox-remaster
Full recreation of the Squeezebox, created from near-scratch in OpenSCAD.  I want this to be cheap, thus I'm going with a Pi Pico vs an Elite-C or Elite Pi.  I'm aiming to support Kailh Choc-style switches with low-pro keycaps

For printing, I am not able get away without supports entirely.  I printed with support blockers around any posts and supports enabled touching the build plate only.

I'd print with at least 3 walls and 25% infill.  I use a small brim (10 lines) to improve adhesion, and then clean up with my deburring tool afterwards.

Intended BOM for the final build:

Print
* Single column x6
* Double column x2
* Thumb cluster x2
* Base plate x2
* Tenting mount x2

Bring
* RPI Pico x2
* M4 heat inserts
* M4x10 bolts
* Wire
* TRRS Jack
* TRRS Wire
